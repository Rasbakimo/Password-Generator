For this assignment we were tasked with asking the user some questions to generate a password. 
to go about this, I uesd a promt to ask how long the user wanted the pass word with an 8 char minimum. 
After that, an if else was used to keep the password over 8 characters.
to be specific about what types of characters the user want, the simplicty of confirm seemed like the way to go.
after the user confirms what it wants, some if else and alerts are used.
once all questions are used a random password is generated.
